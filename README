Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## ABOUT

Postmaster assist is a collection of shell scripts which make it
easier to update the FreeBSD ports collection on the commandline.

Instead of having to manually use portsnap (to update the ports
collection) or portmaster (to upgrade the installed ports) the
entire process is basically done using 2 scripts.
