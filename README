Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## ABOUT

Postmaster assist is a collection of three shell scripts which make
it easier to maintain the FreeBSD ports collection on the commandline.

Instead of having to manually use programs like portsnap or Git (to
update the ports collection) and portmaster (to upgrade the installed
ports) the entire process can basically be done using 2 commands:

./refresh
./update

I've been using this setup for a long time on my own servers and
after a friend of mine told me how much they enjoyed the scripts I
decided that I should share these with the rest of the FreeBSD
community. Many people enjoy(ed) this and I hope that you do too.

Be sure to also check out the TODO file :)

## FEATURES

 * Updates the ports collection and also checks /usr/ports/UPDATING for
   any relevant entries since the last run. If any UPDATING instructions
   are found then those get copied to a separate logfile called
   ./refresh-updating.log.

 * Upgrades all installed ports using Portmaster while also keeping a
   separate logfile (which is useful as reference when something goes
   wrong).

 * Can use ~/portmasterfail.txt to continue a failed update run.

## USAGE

Clone the repository to a working directory, then run 'refresh' to
update the ports collection. This will generate several files amongst
which 'portmaster.log' and 'refresh.log'. The latter contains a list
of all ports for which an update is available.

Then run 'update' to actually upgrade all the relevant ports. The
script will start Portmaster and log all output to 'update.log'.
