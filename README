Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## ABOUT

Postmaster assist is a collection of shell scripts which make it
easier to maintain the FreeBSD ports collection on the commandline.

Instead of having to manually use programs like portsnap (to update
the ports collection) or portmaster (to upgrade the installed ports)
the entire process can basically be done using 2 scripts.

## FEATURES

Updates the ports collection and also checks /usr/ports/UPDATING for any
relevant entries since the last run. If any UPDATING instructions are
found then those get copied to a separate logfile.

Upgrades all installed ports using Portmaster while also keeping a
logfile.

Can use /tmp/portmasterfail.txt to continue a failed installation run.

## USAGE

Clone the repository to a working directory, then run 'refresh' to
update the ports collection. This will generate several files amongst
which 'portmaster.log' and 'refresh.log'. The latter contains a list
of all ports for which an update is available.

Then run 'update' to actually upgrade all the relevant ports. The
script will start Portmaster and log all output to 'update.log'.
