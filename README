Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## ABOUT

Postmaster assist is a collection of shell scripts which make it
easier to maintain the FreeBSD ports collection on the commandline.

Instead of having to manually use programs like portsnap (to update
the ports collection) or portmaster (to upgrade the installed ports)
the entire process can basically be done using 2 scripts.

## FUNCTIONS

Updates the ports collection and checks /usr/ports/UPDATING for any
relevant entries since the last run. When found those get listed in
a separate log file.

Upgrades all installed ports using Portmaster while also keeping a
logfile.

Can use /tmp/portmasterfail.txt to continue a failed installation run.

## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

At the time of writing the scripts are not ready for "Out of the box"
usage, see also the wiki.
