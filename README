Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## ABOUT

Postmaster assist is a collection of shell scripts which make it
easier to maintain the FreeBSD ports collection on the commandline.

Instead of having to manually use programs like portsnap (to update
the ports collection) or portmaster (to upgrade the installed ports)
the entire process can basically be done using 2 scripts.

I've been using this setup for a long time on my own servers and
after a friend of mine told me how much they enjoyed the scripts I
decided that I should (try to) share this with the rest of the
FreeBSD community. Many people enjoy(ed) this and I hope that you
do too.

Be sure to check out the TODO file too :)

## FEATURES

 * Updates the ports collection and also checks /usr/ports/UPDATING for
   any relevant entries since the last run. If any UPDATING instructions
   are found then those get copied to a separate logfile.

 * Upgrades all installed ports using Portmaster while also keeping a
   separate logfile.

 * Can use /tmp/portmasterfail.txt to continue a failed installation run.

 * Has (limited) jail support, this is work in progress.

## USAGE

Clone the repository to a working directory, then run 'refresh' to
update the ports collection. This will generate several files amongst
which 'portmaster.log' and 'refresh.log'. The latter contains a list
of all ports for which an update is available.

Then run 'update' to actually upgrade all the relevant ports. The
script will start Portmaster and log all output to 'update.log'.

For more detailed instructions please see the projects wiki on GitHub,
but I'll be sure to make better documentation a high priority.
