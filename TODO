Portmaster Assist

## TODO list, last update: 11th of November, 2018.

This is a brief summary, for a full up to date overview please
see the project wiki on GitHub.

* Documentation * (WIP)

Right now the documentation is a bit lacking, I'm hoping to fully
sort this out soon.

* Repository support * (PF)

Many people turn to automated tools to build their own repository,
but I actually prefer vanilla tools. As such I also want this project
to eventually be able to maintain a repository which can then be
used by other servers.
