Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## TODO list, last update: April, 2021.

This is a brief summary, for a full up to date overview please
see the project wiki on GitHub.

* Faster detection for moved ports * (WIP)

The 'portmaster.log' file is used to detect moved ports, but the
generation of this file takes time. The idea is to try and use
/usr/ports/MOVED to detect recent changes.

* Support for deleted ports * (WIP)

In addition to the previous point: it might be useful if the
script would issue a warning when it detects an installed port
which is no longer maintained.

* Error handling * (PF)

Sometimes a build can fail due to vulnerabilities being present in
the port, the solution is to temporarily disable this check. This
feature would detect such failed builds and then provide an option to
restart the installation with the override.
