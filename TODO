Portmaster Assist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## TODO list, last update: 10th of May, 2018.

This project is still ongoing, there are several features which I'm
working on and those which I still want to eventually add. Here's
a rough overview.

* Documentation * (WIP)

Right now the documentation is a bit lacking, I'm hoping to fully
sort this out soon.

* (better) Jail support * (WIP)

I build most of my ports on my main server itself, but also
sporadically using a dedicated jail. This is something I still
need to thoroughly test, the feature is beta at best.

* Repository support * (PF)

Many people turn to automated tools to build their own repository,
but I actually prefer vanilla tools. As such I also want this project
to eventually be able to maintain a repository which can then be
used by other servers.
